    <h1>Guessing Game</h1>
    <p>It's typical Portuguese pastry. Unfortunately, there is only one left... we will make a little game to decide who will get it. If a player guesses a secret number, he or she wins it!</p>
    <form action="#">
        <label for="number">Who won the cake? Guess a number between 1 and 24</label>
        <input type="text" id="number" name="number">
        <input type="submit" value="Play">
